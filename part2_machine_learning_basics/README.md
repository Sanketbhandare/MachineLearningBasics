### 3 Techniques of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

1. Supervised Learning: it deals with 2 types of problems
	
	#### 1. Regression --> Linear Regression, Non-Linear Regression, Baysian Linear Regression
	#### 2. Classification --> Naive Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression

2. Unsupervised Learning: no labelled dataset, it explores the underlying patterns and predict the output.

        #### 1. Neural Networks
	#### 2. K - Means clustering
	#### 3. Principal Component Analysis

3. Reforcement Learning --> 
	a. learning agent, with start & end state. 
	b. It tries to manipulate the environment. 
	c. Agent travels from 1 state to another.
        d. Agent gets reward on success and nothing if it's failure. This way, the agent learn from environment.
